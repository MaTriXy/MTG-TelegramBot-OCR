# MTG-TelegramBot-OCR
My Telegram bot scan with Tesseract Magic The Gathering cards

I just include this project: https://github.com/Trafitto/Py-MTG-OCR 
into a Telegram Bot

For the bot i only use Requests

THIS IS A TEST: I just wanna try to do a bot witout any external (bot) pakage, 
I mix it with OCR because it seems to be fun and useful.

English isnâ€™t my first language, so please excuse any mistakes.
